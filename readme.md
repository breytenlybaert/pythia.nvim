# Pythia-nvim

## Introduction

I wanted to create a small personalized llm script for nvim integration fitting with my needs.
This script is based on:

- [melbaldove/llm](https://github.com/melbaldove/llm.nvim)
- [yacineMTB/dingllm](https://github.com/yacineMTB/dingllm.nvim)

So we introduce Pythia.nvim . As with all autogenerated nonsense, the interpretation is to be left to the listeners.

## Configuration
