# Pythia-nvim

## Introduction

I wanted to create a small personalized llm script for nvim integration fitting with my needs.
UPDATED:
Switched over to integrating with Simon's cli llm tool - to be explained.

So we introduce Pythia.nvim . As with all autogenerated nonsense, the interpretation is to be left to the listeners.
